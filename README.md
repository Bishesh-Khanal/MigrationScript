# MigrationScript

Database migration scripts are structured sets of instructions that allows the incremental modification of a database schema in a controlled and versioned way. Each migration typically has an “up” script to apply changes (like creating tables or adding columns) and a “down” script to revert them, ensuring safe rollbacks. A migration system tracks which scripts have been applied—often using a dedicated table in the database—so that changes are applied in order and only once, maintaining idempotency. This approach makes schema changes predictable, reversible, and easier to manage across development, testing, and production environments. Using C++ with MySQL Connector in Visual Studio 2022, I implemented a simple migration runner that executes these SQL scripts programmatically, checks applied versions, and ensures that each migration runs only once, automating schema updates while maintaining consistency while also storing exceptions in a .log file. The SQL queries are to be stored in .sql files in a folder 'migrations' in the same directory as the solution. The .sql files are to be in the format '001_create_users_up.sql', '001_create_users_down.sql', '002_add_email_up.sql', '002_add_email_down.sql', etc.
